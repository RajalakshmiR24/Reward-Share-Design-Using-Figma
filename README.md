# Reward Share

## A Platform for Sharing and Utilizing Unused Rewards from Daily Use Applications

![image](https://github.com/RajalakshmiR24/Reward-Share-Design-Using-Figma/assets/127002476/58ebc1a1-6c2d-4c1f-bef7-16e3356e18d4)


In today's digital world, users receive rewards from various daily use applications such as PhonePe, Google Pay, Paytm, Swiggy, and Zomato. However, often, we don't use them before they expire. So, I am going to start this project called Reward Share. It's a website where you can share your unused rewards with others. This platform operates on a rotational system where User 1 can share their rewards, unlocking more rewards for themselves, and User 2 can collect and utilize them. We ensure that the rewards are valid when you share them. This is my website project that I am going to design and develop using Figma.

## How it Works:

When you receive a reward on another app, you can choose to share it with another user. As User 1, you have the power to spread the joy of rewards. By sharing, you not only make someone else happy but also receive a portion of the reward yourself.

## Benefits:

1. **Sharing Economy:** Join the movement of sharing and caring. Sharing rewards fosters a sense of community and generosity.
2. **Double Rewards:** As User 1, you not only share your rewards but also receive a portion for yourself.
3. **Access to Free Rewards:** User 2 benefits by receiving free rewards, courtesy of User 1's generosity.
4. **Simple and Seamless:** Our platform makes sharing rewards as easy as a few clicks, enhancing user experience.

## Join Us:

Join our community of sharers and receivers. Experience the joy of giving and receiving rewards like never before!

## Budget:

1. **Web Hosting:** ₹3,500 to ₹35,000 per month
2. **Domain Name:** ₹700 to ₹3,500 per year
3. **SSL Certificate:** ₹3,500 to ₹14,000 per year
4. **Payment Gateway Fees:** Transaction fees of approximately 2.9% + ₹3 per transaction
5. **Maintenance and Updates:** ₹7,000 to ₹35,000 per month
6. **Marketing and Promotion:** ₹20,000 to ₹1,00,000 per month
7. **Legal and Compliance:** Consultation fees of ₹10,000 to ₹50,000
8. **Customer Support:** ₹15,000 to ₹50,000 per month

## Statistical Data:

| Likelihood of Using Platform | Frequency of Receiving Rewards | Factors Encouraging Sharing | Positive Impact on Experience | Interest in Receiving Updates |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Very likely (6)              | Daily (5)                      | Helping others (7)          | Yes (10)                      | Yes (10)                       |
| Likely (5)                   | Weekly (4)                     | Building community (4)      | No (2)                        | No (2)                         |
| Neutral (3)                  | Monthly (2)                    | Receiving a portion (3)     | Maybe (4)                     | Maybe (4)                      |

## Competitor Site or Strategy:

Some other websites or apps do similar things:

- **Points.com:** This is where you can manage and swap your loyalty points and rewards from different programs.

## Client Profit Convenience:

Reward Share benefits both users and the people running it:

- **User Engagement:** Users return for easy reward sharing and receiving, boosting platform usage.
- **Revenue Opportunities:** Operators can earn extra through partnerships, ads, or unique features.
- **Brand Image:** Joining Reward Share enhances a company's image by demonstrating community care.
- **Data Insights:** Collected data helps companies improve their services based on user preferences.

## Figma Design:

The design and prototype of this project will be created using Figma. This includes:

1. **User Interface Design:** Creating intuitive and user-friendly interfaces for easy navigation and interaction.
2. **Prototyping:** Developing clickable prototypes to simulate the user experience.
3. **Design System:** Establishing a consistent design language with reusable components and styles.
4. **User Flows:** Mapping out the journey of a user from reward sharing to receiving.
5. **Collaboration:** Facilitating real-time collaboration and feedback with stakeholders.

Stay tuned for the upcoming designs and share your feedback to make Reward Share a success!
